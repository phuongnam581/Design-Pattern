Think of it like building a burger or decorating a Christmas tree:
- Start with something basic (plain burger, bare tree)
- Keep adding layers/decorations on top
- Each addition enhances the original without changing its core
- You can add as many layers as you want!

Key Concept: "Wrap" objects to add new functionality
